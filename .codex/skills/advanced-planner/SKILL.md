# Advanced Planner

1. Read `.claude/commands/advanced-planner.md` for the full workflow and output format.
2. Build a Tool Inventory and Execution Roadmap before any edits.
3. Validate files and functions with Glob/Grep/Read before claiming they exist.
4. Use structured reasoning for architecture or multi-solution decisions.
5. Prefer parallel tool batches when tasks are independent.
