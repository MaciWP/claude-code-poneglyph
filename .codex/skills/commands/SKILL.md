# Commands List

1. List `.claude/commands/*.md` to discover command files.
2. Read the YAML frontmatter of each file to extract the description.
3. Present a short list grouped by category when possible; otherwise list all.
4. Note that Codex uses skills, but these commands mirror the legacy Claude workflows.
